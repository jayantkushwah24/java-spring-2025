# Complete In-Depth Notes on Java String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer
(Combined + Expanded Version)

This document merges **all concepts from the previous two answers** and adds additional depth expected in **FAANG-level and top product company interviews**.

# 1. What Exactly Is a String in Java?

A `String` in Java is:

- A **final**, **immutable**, **value-based** class.
- Internally backed by:
    - **JDK 8 and below:** `char[] value`
    - **JDK 9+:** `byte[] value` + `byte coder` (Compact Strings)
- Implements `Serializable`, `Comparable<String>`, and `CharSequence`.

Java Strings are heavily optimized for:

- Security
- Performance
- Memory efficiency
- Thread-safety
- Deduplication & interning

---

# 2. Why String Is Immutable (Full Technical Reasoning)

### 2.1 Security
Strings are used in:

- Class names
- ClassLoader internals
- File paths
- Network hosts
- Database connection URLs
- Environment variables
- Password strings

Mutability would create major security risks.

### 2.2 String Pooling Requires Immutability
The JVM depends on immutability to safely:

- Reuse string literals
- Cache references
- Avoid synchronization

### 2.3 HashCode Caching
`hashCode` is cached inside the object:

```java
private int hash; // zero until computed once

If the content changed, hash-based collections would break.

2.4 Thread-Safety for Free

Immutable objects have:

No internal synchronization

Safe publication guarantees

Zero race conditions

2.5 Final Class

String is final to prevent overriding methods that would break immutability.

3. Memory Model: Heap, SCP, Runtime Constant Pool
3.1 The String Constant Pool (SCP)

Stored inside heap (Java 7+)

Prior to Java 7 → stored in PermGen

Holds unique string literals

String literals are loaded by the ClassLoader, not created with new.

Example:

String s1 = "abc";
String s2 = "abc";


Both reference the same object in the SCP.

3.2 Heap Strings

Created using:

String s = new String("abc");


Creates:

"abc" literal in SCP (if not already present)

A new String object on heap

Why 2 objects?

SCP literal

A new heap object containing its own backing array (or copy)

4. Internal Implementation Differences (JDK 8 vs JDK 9+)
JDK 8
private final char[] value;


Always UTF-16

Memory-heavy, especially for ASCII text

JDK 9+: Compact Strings
private final byte[] value;
private final byte coder; // LATIN1=0, UTF16=1


Benefits:

50% less memory for ASCII-heavy workloads

Faster operations due to reduced footprint

5. Substring Internals (Memory-Leak Story)
JDK 6 & JDK 7 (pre-7u6)

substring used to reference the original array:

String big = "bigstring....";
String small = big.substring(0, 5);


small shared the same large char array → memory leak risk.

JDK 7u6+

Substring creates a new array copy.

6. String Interning — Full Mechanics

intern() inserts the string into SCP.

String s1 = new String("x");
String s2 = s1.intern();
String s3 = "x";


s2 == s3 → true

s1 == s2 → false

JVM intern behavior across versions:
Version	Pool Location
Java 6	PermGen
Java 7+	Heap
Java 8+	Heap (improved deduplication)
7. String Concatenation — Compiler & JVM Behavior
7.1 Compile-Time Concatenation (Constant Folding)
String s = "a" + "b" + "c";


Compiler rewrites as:

String s = "abc";


Zero runtime overhead.

7.2 Runtime Concatenation
String s = a + b;


Compiler rewrites to:

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.append(a);
sb.append(b);
s = sb.toString();


This is why loops like this are slow:

String s = "";
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    s = s + i;
}

Time complexity = O(n²)
8. StringBuilder — Internal Working, Capacity Growth, Performance

StringBuilder is:

Mutable

Fastest for building strings

Not synchronized

Internal structure (simplified):

char[] value;
int count;

Capacity Expansion Formula:
newCapacity = oldCapacity * 2 + 2


Advantages:

Amortized O(1) append

Far fewer allocations

9. StringBuffer — Thread-Safe Version of StringBuilder

All methods are synchronized

Slower than StringBuilder

Use only when:

Multiple threads share the same buffer

And they modify it concurrently

Otherwise, it's unnecessary overhead.

10. Escape Analysis & Stack Allocation (Advanced JVM Optimization)

JIT checks whether an object “escapes” its scope.

If not, it performs:

Scalar replacement

Stack allocation

Object removal from heap → NO GC cost

Example:

String concat() {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    sb.append("a");
    sb.append("b");
    return sb.toString();
}


JVM may:

Eliminate the StringBuilder object entirely

Inline the entire operation

11. Bytecode for String Concatenation

Example:

String x = "a" + b;


Bytecode (simplified):

new StringBuilder
dup
invokespecial <init>
ldc "a"
invokevirtual append
aload_1
invokevirtual append
invokevirtual toString
astore_2

12. G1 GC String Deduplication

G1 GC can automatically deduplicate identical strings:

During marking phase, JVM detects identical arrays

Replaces duplicates with shared arrays

Huge memory savings in:

Microservices

Web servers

High-throughput systems

13. JOL-Based Object Layout (Simplified)

For a String object:

String object:
  - Mark word (12 bytes)
  - Class pointer (4 or 8 bytes)
  - int hash
  - byte coder
  - reference to byte[] value

byte[]:
  - Mark word
  - Class pointer
  - int length
  - n bytes of data


Actual size depends on:

JVM word size

CompressedOops

Alignment padding

14. Comparison: String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer
Feature	String	StringBuilder	StringBuffer
Mutable	No	Yes	Yes
Thread-safe	Yes	No	Yes
Performance	Slow for concatenation	Fastest	Middle
Pooling	Yes	No	No
Use-case	Keys, configs, constants	Local concatenation	Multi-threaded shared buffer
Storage	byte[]	char[]	char[]

How does interning work?

Why is StringBuilder faster?

16. Coding Anti-Patterns to Avoid
16.1 String concatenation inside loops

Bad:

String s = "";
for (...) s += i;


Good:

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

17. Common Interview Traps
Trap 1:
"abc" == "abc" // true (SCP)

Trap 2:
new String("abc") == "abc" // false

Trap 3:
"a" + "b" // compile-time optimization

Trap 4:
"a" + new String("b") // runtime concatenation → NOT SCP

Trap 5:

String interning changes between Java versions.

18. Summary (FAANG-Level)

String = immutable, final, value-based, compact representation, pooled, cached hash.

StringBuilder = mutable, fast, unsynchronized, best for concatenation.

StringBuffer = mutable, synchronized, slower, only for multi-thread shared buffers.

SCP resides in heap (post Java 7).

Interned strings are reused across the JVM classloader space.

JVM performs aggressive optimizations: constant folding, escape analysis, deduplication.

Understanding bytecode behavior is essential for top-tier interviews.
