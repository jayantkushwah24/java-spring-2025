1234

yaml
Copy code
Explain how nested loops work line-by-line.

---

## 15. What is the difference between `break`, `continue`, and `return`?  
Explain with examples inside:
- loops  
- switch  
- nested loops  
- labeled loops  

---

## 16. Explain labeled break and continue in detail.  
Write a program demonstrating:
- breaking outer loop  
- continuing outer loop  

---

## 17. Explain the difference between `while` and `do-while`.

- for  
- while  
- do-while  

Explain evaluation at each iteration.

---

## 19. Explain the role of expressions inside for-loop:
for(initialization; condition; update)

yaml
Copy code
Give 5 unusual for-loop examples:
- no condition  
- no initialization  
- no update  
- all three missing  
- multiple updates

## 20. What are control flow statements?  
Explain in depth:
- decision-making (if, else, switch)  
- loops (for, while, do-while, enhanced for)  
- branching (break, continue, return)  
Describe how JVM handles each.
